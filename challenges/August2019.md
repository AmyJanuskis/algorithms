Theme: **Hash tables**

## Explain the following:
- What is **direct addressing**?
- How is a hash table implemented?
- What is the time complexity and space complexity of creating a hash table to solve a problem?
- When would the time complexity of a hash table closer to **linear** instead of **constant**?
- In what scenarios would you use a hash table to solve a problem?
