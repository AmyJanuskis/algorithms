## Slides on "Linked List - quick revision"
From the event, here's the [slide deck on a quick revision of linked list data structure - TBD]()

## Interview knowledge questions
These questions seek to judge your understanding of CS Fundamentals and of the primary programming language of your choice.

Explain the following:
- Compare an array and linked list data structure. When would you use one over the other?
- What is the difference between a **pointer** and a **reference**?
- What is a **memory Access Violation** or **AV**?
- What is a **memory leak**? What's the harm with memory leaks?
- Does *<fill in your primary programming language of choice>, e.g. Java or Ruby*, provide an implementation of LinkedList as part of the common library?
- Does *<fill in your primary programming language of choice>, e.g. Java or Ruby*, have a garbage collector? How does the garbage collector work?
