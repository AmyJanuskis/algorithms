# String Reverse

## Exercise
* Design and implement a method to reverse a string *in place*. The method takes the string to be reversed as input parameter.
* Above the method, elaborate the comment to share the time and space complexity of your method.
    * Your solution should optimize the space complexity as much as possible. In other words, do not use any more space than needed.
    * If you explain the complexity in terms of *n*, be sure to explain what *n* stands for.
* For example, if the method is called with input parameter of "*Lovelace*", the method should update the input string object to have the value "*ecalevoL*".

* <b>Notes</b>: 
    * Strings are not mutable in all programming languages. If you're coding in a language where strings are not mutable, return a new string with the characters of the input string in reverse order.
