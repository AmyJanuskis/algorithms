## Slides on "A quick revision of Computer Memory"
From the event, here's the [slide deck on a quick revision of computer memory](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16_OoNkO9w0Eiw-ReOf7cc5YSAd4yBlPR)

## Interview knowledge questions
These questions seek to judge your understanding of CS Fundamentals and of the primary programming language of your choice.

Explain the following:
- What is the difference between a **pointer** and a **reference**?
- What is a **memory Access Violation** or **AV**?
- What is a **memory leak**? What's the harm with memory leaks?
- In *<fill in your primary programming language of choice>, e.g. Java or Ruby*, are Strings mutable?
- Does *<fill in your primary programming language of choice>, e.g. Java or Ruby*, have a garbage collector? How does the garbage collector work?
