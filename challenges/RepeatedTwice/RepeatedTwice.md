# Reated Twice
Determine the element repeated twice in an unsorted array.

## Exercise
* An unsorted array has all unique elements except one. Design an algorithm/method to find the repeating element.
* Share and explain the time and space complexities for your solution in the comments above the method.
* If you think of multiple approaches to solve the problem, implement the solution which minimizes space complexity. Explain the other approaches, and your decision in comments above the code.

* For example,
   - [35, 42, 7, 10, -18, 42, 63] should return 42.
   - [8, 3, 2, 1, 1, 9, 4] should return 1.
   - [9, 9] should return 9.
