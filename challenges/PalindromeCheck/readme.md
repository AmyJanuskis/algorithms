# Palindrome Check

## Exercise
* Design and implement a method that checks if the input string is a palindrome. The method should return true, if the input string is a palindrome and return false, if it is not a palindrome.
    * Do not alter the input string.
    * Find a solution that optimizes the space complexity as much as possible. In other words, check if your algorithm can avoid duplicating the original string.
* Share and explain the time and space complexities for your solution in the comments above the method.
    * If you describe the complexity in terms of *n*, be sure to explain what *n* stands for.
* Palindrome is a word, phrase or sentence that reads the same backwards as it does forwards. e.g. "madam"
    * For this exercise purposes, white spaces are ignored while checking for a palindrome string.

<b>Notes</b>:
- You may retrieve a character at a given index, or update a character at a given index using any available approach.
