# String Anagrams

## Exercise
* Design and implement a method to check if the two input parameter strings are anagrams of each other. 
  The method should return `true` if the two input parameters are anagrams of each other. Otherwise, return `false`.
* Explain the time and space complexity of your solution
* Can you think of more than one solution?

* Anagrams: Two strings are anagrams if you can rearrange the characters in one string to create the other string. e.g. "iceman" and "cinema".
