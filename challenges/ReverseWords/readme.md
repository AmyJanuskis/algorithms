# Reverse words

## Exercise
* Design and implement a method to reverse each word in a sentence in place. The sentence to reverse is passed in as the input parameter to the function. Design your algorithm to optimize the space complexity to be as minimal as possible.
* For example, if the method is called with input parameter of "I can be an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engineer", the method should update the input string object to have the value "I nac eb na&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reenigne".
    * Note that the count of white spaces between words is preserved.
* Share and explain the time and space complexities for your solution in the comment above the method.
    * If the complexity is described in terms of *n*, your explanation must share what *n* stands for.

**Notes**:
* Do not use language provided functionality for `.reverse` and `.reverse!`.
* You may use `.length` method provided in the language's standard libraries.
* If you choose to code in a language in which Strings are not mutable, return a new string with each word in the input string reversed.
