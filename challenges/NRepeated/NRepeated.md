## N repeated
An array of size 2N with N+1 distinct elements and one element repeated N times.

### Exercise
A method takes an array of size 2N. There are N+1 unique elements and exactly one element is repeated N times. Design the algorithm for the method to return the element that is repeated N times.

- What is the time and space complexity of your solution?
- Can you think of a solution that optimizes for memory or space?
- Can you think of a solution that optimizes for time?
 

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,3]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: [2,1,2,5,3,2]
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]
Output: 5
 

Note:
4 <= A.length <= 10000
0 <= A[i] < 10000
A.length is even
