### Two Sum

Design a method that takes an array of positive integers and returns the indices of the two distinct values in the array that sum up to a specific target value.

**Notes**:
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
- Can you think of at least two solutions/algorithms to solve the problem: one that is space efficient and another that is time efficient?

**Example**:
If the inputs to the method are: array: [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, then the method should return [0, 1] because array[0] and array[1] i.e. 2 and 7 sum up to the target value of 9.

**Add on challenge**: Extend your solution so that it returns **all pairs** of indices that solve the problem.
