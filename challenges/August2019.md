Theme: **Hash tables**

## Slides on Hash Tables
From the event, here's the [slide deck on Hash Tables](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pFtUeKQZjqFUXNeCSn8O1Rhw-jRaA21XjouirVre_0k/edit?usp=sharing)

## Interview knowledge questions
Explain the following:
- What is **direct addressing**?
- How is a hash table implemented?
- What is the time complexity and space complexity of creating a hash table to solve a problem?
- When would the time complexity of a hash table closer to **linear** instead of **constant**?
- In what scenarios would you use a hash table to solve a problem?
- What is a **collison** in the context of a hash table? Explain one design approach used to deal with collisions.
- In *<fill in your primary programming language of choice>, e.g. Java or Ruby*, what is/are language provided implementations of choice? If there are more than one, what are the differences between them? *(e.g. HashMap vs. HashSet in Java)*
