# Reverse Sentence

## Exercise
* Design and implement a method to reverse the words in a sentence *in place*. The string of words to be reversed in passed in as the input parameter to the method.
    * Your algorithm should strive to optimize the space complexity as much as possible.
* For example, if the method is called with input parameter of "Yoda&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awesome", then the method should update the input string object to have the value "awesome&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoda".
    * Note that the count of white spaces between words is preserved.
* Share and explain the time and space complexities for your solution in the comments above the method.
    * If the complexity is shared in terms of *n*, your explanation must explain what *n* stands for.

**Notes**:
* Do not use language provided functionality for `.reverse` and `.reverse!`.
* You may use `.length` method provided in the language's standard libraries.
* If you choose to code in a language in which Strings are not mutable, return a new string with each word in the input string reversed.
